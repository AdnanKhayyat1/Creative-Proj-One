             <p>Water covers 71% of the Earth's surface, mostly in seas and oceans.Small portions of water occur as groundwater, in the glaciers and the ice caps of Antarctica and Greenland, and in the air as vapor, clouds (formed of ice and liquid water suspended in air), and precipitation. <br>

                    Water plays an important role in the world economy. Approximately 70% of the freshwater used by humans goes to agriculture. Fishing in salt and fresh water bodies is a major source of food for many parts of the world. Much of long-distance trade of commodities (such as oil and natural gas) and manufactured products is transported by boats through seas, rivers, lakes, and canals. Large quantities of water, ice, and steam are used for cooling and heating, in industry and homes. Water is an excellent solvent for a wide variety of chemical substances; as such it is widely used in industrial processes, and in cooking and washing. Water is also central to many sports and other forms of entertainment, such as swimming, pleasure boating, boat racing, surfing, sport fishing, and diving. </p>
